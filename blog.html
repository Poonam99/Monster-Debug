            <h2>Difference between local storage and session storage:</h2>
            <li>
                <p>sessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't
                    expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends.The storage capacity of local
                    storage is 5MB/10MB.
                    The storage capacity of session storage is 5MB</p>

            <h2>Difference between Global scope and Blog scope:</h2>
            <li>
                <p>A global variable has global scope. A global variable is accessible from anywhere in the code.Global
                    scope — Global scope contains all of the things defined outside of all code blocks. A code block
                    simply consists of grouped statements inside curly braces ({ }). Local Scope — Local scope contains
                    things defined inside code blocks. A local variable has local scope.A local variable is only
                    accessible where it’s declared.</p>

            <h2> How Event loop works in js :</h2>
            <li>
                <p>The Event Loop has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call
                    Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call
                    Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.A programming
                    structure that continually tests for external events and calls the appropriate routines to handle
                    them. An event loop is often the main loop in a program that typically waits for the user to trigger
                    something
